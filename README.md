# Fairport Run Data API
## Overview
This repository contains the python scripts that collect and aggregate data from Fairport's runners.
The data is then served through an api defined in `main.py`
## Data Collection
Most of the data is collected through the https://yentiming.com api which is not publicly available and had to be reverse engineered.
