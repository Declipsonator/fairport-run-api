# Fairport Run Data Collection
## Overview
This repository contains the python scripts that collect and aggregate data from Fairport's runners.
This not only provides a way to track the performance of the runners, but also allows for the analysis of the data to improve training and performance.
## Data Collection
Most of the data is collected through the https://yentiming.com api which is not publicly available and had to be reverse engineered.
